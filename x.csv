Source: KBB.com<br>  * Exceptionally smooth and quiet ride; satisfying V8 power; upscale cabin; lots of features; top crash test scores; satisfying sound systems; available all-wheel drive. Source: Edmunds<br>  * Classic design has been redefined in a way only Detroit could imagine. An integrated rear spoiler pays homage to its tail-finned 1950s predecessors. A raked-back windshield and forward leaning fascia create improved aerodynamics with an aggressive stance. And tailored finishes of the iconic grille, LED headlamps and taillamps give the Chrysler 300 a look unlike any other. Available Bi-Xenon HID headlamps also provide a confident look at the road ahead, producing three times more light than halogen headlamps. Every detail in the Chrysler 300 is designed to steer you towards refinement. Premium finishes and soft-touch materials give dramatic depth to interior surfaces. The instrument panel celebrates classic American design, with LED-backlit gauges both casting a sapphire-blue glow and adding clarity to readouts. The acoustic properties of the cabin reduce outside noise and increase interior peace. The standard Uconnect System is Detroit know-how and intuitive technology on display. This 8.4-inch interactive touchscreen display allows you to access your cell phone, SiriusXM Satellite Radio+, MP3 player, HVAC and more. It's luxury at the touch of a finger. Power, efficiency and control all add up in the 2013 Chrysler 300. The 3.6L Pentastar V6 produces up to 300 horsepower and a powerfully efficient 19 city / 31 highway mpg. The Chrysler 5.7L HEMI V8 delivers a road-gripping 363 horsepower with a gas-sipping 16 city / 25 highway mpg. Features like the new eight-speed automatic transmission help maximize performance and mpg - so you can spend more time hitting the gas a","Light Group|Luxury Group|Quick Order Package 29G|SafetyTec|10 Speakers|AM/FM radio: SiriusXM|Audio Jack Input for Mobile Devices|CD player|DVD-Audio|Radio data system|Radio: Uconnect 8.4 CD/DVD/MP3|Remote USB Port|SIRIUS Satellite Radio|Air Conditioning|Automatic temperature control|Front dual zone A/C|Rear window defroster|Heated Second Row Seats|Power Adjustable Pedals w/Memory|Power driver seat|Power steering|Power windows|Radio/Driver Seat/Mirrors Memory|Remote keyless entry|Steering wheel mounted audio controls|Four wheel independent suspension|Speed-sensing steering|Traction control|4-Wheel Disc Brakes|ABS brakes|Anti-whiplash front head restraints|Dual front impact airbags|Dual front side impact airbags|Front anti-roll bar|Knee airbag|Low tire pressure warning|Occupant sensing airbag|Overhead airbag|Rear anti-roll bar|Blind Spot & Cross Path Detection|Brake assist|Electronic Stability Control|ParkView Rear Back-Up Camera|Adaptive Bi-Xenon HID Headlamps|Automatic Headlamp Leveling System|Delay-off headlights|Front fog lights|Fully automatic headlights|Rear Fog Lamps|Panic alarm|Security system|Adaptive Speed Control|Speed control|Auto Adjust In Reverse Exterior Mirrors|Auto High Beam Headlamp Control|Auto-Dimming Exterior Driver Mirror|Bumpers: body-color|Exterior Mirrors Courtesy Lamps|Exterior Mirrors w/Supplemental Signals|Heated door mirrors|Power door mirrors|Power Multi Function Mirror Manual Fold|Pwr Multi Function Mirror Manual Fold|8.4"" Touch Screen Display|Auto-dimming Rear-View mirror|Compass|Door Sill Scuff Pads|Driver door bin|Driver vanity mirror|Driver/Passenger Lower LED Lamps|Forward Collision Warning|Front reading lights|Garage door transmitter|Heated Steering Wheel|Heated/Cooled Front Console Cupholder|Illuminated entry|Leather Shift Knob|Outside temperature display|Overhead console|ParkSense Front/Rear Park Assist System|Passenger vanity mirror|Power Tilt & Telescopic Steering Column|Rear reading lights|Rear seat center armrest|Tachometer|Telescoping steering wheel|Tilt steering wheel|Trip computer|Trunk Mat|Front Bucket Seats|Front Center Armrest|Heated front seats|Leather Trimmed Sport Bucket Seats|Power passenger seat|Split folding rear seat|Front & Rear LED Map Pockets|Passenger door bin|19"" x 7.5"" Cast Aluminum Wheels|Alloy wheels|Power Backlight Sunshade|Rain Sensitive Windshield Wipers|Speed-Sensitive Wipers|Variably intermittent wipers|Clean Carfax","http://vehicle-photos-published.vauto.com/cf/9c/00/05-7489-4e98-8ddb-607c7cee8ac7/image-1.jpg","15","23","11/30/2023 11:55:37 AM","","","","","HEMI 5.7L V8 Multi Displacement VVT","","","","","","R","Gasoline"

Source: KBB.com<br>  * Standard all-wheel drive; relatively strong off-road capabilities; spacious cabin; fuel-efficient hybrid version. Source: Edmunds<br>  * The 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek is an exhilarating alternative to the compact SUVs you are used to seeing. It features a dynamic and aggressive design, with aerodynamic lines, prominent over-fenders, gorgeous wheels, and hawk-eye headlights. Uneven terrain is a breeze with the Crosstrek since it has 8.7 inches of ground clearance complimented by rugged plastic cladding on the lower body panels. Plus, its maximum cargo volume of 51.9 cubic feet gives you plenty of space for your gear. It is offered in two trims: the 2.0i Premium and the 2.0i Limited, and both share a 2.0-liter, 4-cylinder, SUBARU BOXER engine with 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. The Premium comes standard with a 5-Speed manual transmission. However, as an option you can get it with the Lineartronic Continuously Variable Transmission, which is the standard on the Limited. The Lineartronic CVT allows the Crosstrek to get an EPA estimated 25 MPG City and 33 MPG Highway, and it has a manual mode where you can use the paddle shifters for exciting precision driving. Both trims come standard with the incredible Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive. The athletic grip of the XV Crosstrek makes taking corners exciting, and it has responsive handling that keeps your drives enjoyable and fun. Inside, you will experience a spacious and modern cabin, and sit in comfort on adjustable, heated front seats. Both models give you a tilt/telescopic steering wheel with integrated controls for music, Bluetooth, and cruise control. The Premium model comes with a 6-Speaker audio system that includes a CD player, auxiliary jack, USB port, iPod control, hands-free phone connectivity, and Bluetooth audio streaming from compatible phones. The Limited adds HD Radio, 4.3-inch screen, and a rear-vision camera. In addition, the Voice-Activated GPS Navigation system with 6.1-inch touchscreen is an option for both trims. New for 2014, if you opt for the navigation system it now has Aha-based integration with your smartphone.

Source: Edmunds<br>  * Ford Flex is the modern way to move. With bold lettering on the hood, futuristic front grille, and a sleek shape, it is the space for busy families on the go. It comes in 3 trims: the Base SE, the mid range SEL, and the top-tier Limited. Exciting to look at, Flex is equally exciting to drive. Standard on the SE and SEL is the 3.5L V6 with 287hp and 25 MPG HWY, and the Limited gives you choice of the optional 3.5L EcoBoost V6 with 365hp and 23 MPG HWY. Both engines come with a 6-speed SelectShift Automatic transmission. The Flex is full of great technology. Standard SYNC with MyFord keeps you connected to calls, music and more while keeping both hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. Adaptive Cruise Control automatically adjusts the speed of the Flex if there is slowing traffic ahead. If you are getting the Limited, Active Park Assist is available that can identify spots for you to parallel park in and then steer the vehicle into place itself. Flex comes standard with 1st-row bucket seats, 2nd-row 60/40 split bench seat and 3rd-row 50/50 split bench seat for seven-passenger seating. It's amazing how much room there is for all seven passengers, and 2nd-row and 3rd-row legroom is best in class. For a more spacious feel, the available Vista Roof consists of four skylights covering all three rows of seating. The available Navigation System with SiriusXM Traffic and Travel Link combines GPS technology, with voice-guided turn-by-turn directions and 3-D mapping.

Source: KBB.com<br>  * Easy to maneuver in the city; respectable passenger space for its size; plenty of storage slots; lots of standard equipment for the money. Source: Edmunds<br>  * The all-new 2015 Trax gives you the best of both worlds: the versatility of an SUV and the maneuverability to park on city streets. With an elevated view of the road, you can take command of your city's streets. And with the signature Chevrolet dual-port grille, swept-back headlights and available chrome accents, the Trax small SUV is sure to turn heads wherever you go. The interior can be easily reconfigured to maximize versatility, thanks to the 60/40 flip-and-fold rear seat and fold-flat front passenger seat. The fun begins at every stoplight, thanks to the confident acceleration of the 1.4L turbocharged ECOTEC engine that's standard in every Trax. The horsepower is 138, but it's the 148 lb.-ft of at-the-ready torque that makes Trax so responsive to every touch Trax gives you two ways of engaging more directly in your driving, with a standard six-speed manual transmission on LS models, and a six-speed automatic transmission on LT and LTZ models. Turbocharging doesn't only increase power generation, it also enhances fuel efficiency delivering a 5.7L/100 km hwy fuel consumption rating that is unsurpassed. The available Chevrolet MyLink Radio connects your compatible smartphone to the MyLink 178mm color touch-screen display and enables you to use screen, voice commands, or the steering wheel-mounted controls. The system also allows you to access apps like Stitcher SmartRadio and TuneIn that can stream over 70,000 radio stations from around the world and best enjoyed with the available seven-speaker Bose premium sound system that features its own amplifier.

It does this while keeping a competitive price against its peers. Source: KBB.com<br>  * Sporty handling, particularly with the ST model; upscale interior; available luxury features; stable highway road manners; powerful and efficient EcoBoost engine. Source: Edmunds<br>  * With its bright hues like Green Envy and Molten Orange, the 2015 Ford Fiesta is highly capable and a joy to drive. The available Ford SYNC system lets you make hands-free calls, stream music from a compatible phone via Bluetooth, and hear turn-by-turn directions through your speakers. The Fiesta delivers 120hp of fun from its 1.6L engine which achieves up to 28 MPG city and 36 MPG hwy. New for 2015 is a 1.0L turbocharged engine delivering up to 32 MPG city and 45 MPG hwy. For an intense rush the Fiesta ST delivers up to 197hp with its turbocharged engine. Twin independent variable camshaft timing adds an extra measure of precision, improving fuel efficiency and power output. For that extra-connected feel, the PowerShift 6-speed automatic transmission can provide torque to the wheels 100 percent of the time during shifts. The electric power-assisted steering gives compensation for pulling and drifting. To help Fiesta stay sure-footed and firmly planted in the corners, a MacPherson-strut front suspension features specially tuned dampers, spring rates and bushings, and a 22-mm stabilizer bar. On the ST trim get the available RECARO seats, which hold you in place during intense drives with their supportive bolsters. There are also available features like heated front seats and ambient lighting with 7 different hues. For space, Fiesta's 60/40 split rear seat folds down, opening up additional room for your gear. Pass-through access from the trunk increases usable space in the sedan. Underneath its aerodynamic shape, an ultra-high-strength boron safety cage protects you and your passengers. In addition, the AdvanceTrac electronic stability control helps keep all 4 wheels securely on the road.

Source: Edmunds<br>  * The new 2015 Chevy Colorado will appeal to people who want to tow a trailer or carry gear, but want an easier time parking and better fuel economy than a full-size truck offers. It is also more refined, more efficient and more capable than the other trucks in its segment. Source: KBB.com<br>  * With advanced technology to keep you connected, great fuel efficiency, the Chevrolet Colorado is all that you want in a truck. Chevrolet is redefining the midsize pickup from the frame up. Under the hood you can choose from the choice of 2 engines including a 2.5L that produces 200hp and 191lb-ft of torque or a 3.6L V6 that produces 305hp and 269lb-ft of torque with best-in-class 26 MPG hwy fuel economy. It achieves this by implementing innovative powertrain technologies like Spark Ignition Direct Injection and deceleration fuel cutoff, which shuts off fuel to the engine when braking. With the available trailering package, this small truck is rated to tow up to 7,000 lbs. The Colorado small truck offers a Z71 Off-Road Package with precisely tuned suspension that provides an incredibly stable and comfortable ride for off-road performance. The Z71 package also includes an automatic locking rear differential, which sends power to one of the rear wheels when the other one loses traction to help you stay in control. Colorado was designed to be comfortable in any environment, from city streets to camping retreats. Colorado is the first small truck to combine design features such as inlaid, triple-sealed doors, thick windshield and side glass, and liquid-applied sound deadener to help reduce wind noise inside the cab and keep the road noise out. Customize your driving experience by arranging the icons and features on the available Chevrolet MyLink 8-inch diagonal color touch-screen. The interface allows you to touch and swipe on the screen just like you do on your smartphone. Advanced safety features include a standard rear vision camera, available forward collision alert, and lane departure warning.
